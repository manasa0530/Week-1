# Week-1
The project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into predefined categories. This system aims to assist in waste management by accurately distinguishing between different types of plastic.
Here dataset contains images of various objects.It is designed to support the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying and distinguishing between the categories.
<h3>TRAIN</h3>: Contains training images organized into subfolders for each class.
<h3>TEST</h3>: Contains testing images organized similarly.
